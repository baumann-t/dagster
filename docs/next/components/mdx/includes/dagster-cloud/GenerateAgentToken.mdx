In this step, you'll generate a token for the Dagster+ agent. The Dagster+ agent will use this to authenticate to the agent API.

1. Sign in to your Dagster+ instance.
2. Click the **user menu (your icon) > Organization Settings**.
3. In the **Organization Settings** page, click the **Tokens** tab.
4. Click the **+ Create agent token** button.
5. After the token has been created, click **Reveal token**.

Keep the token somewhere handy - you'll need it to complete the setup.
