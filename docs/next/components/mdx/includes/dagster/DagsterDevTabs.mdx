Dagster can load a file directly as a code location. In the following example, we used the `-f` argument to supply the name of the file:

```shell
dagster dev -f my_file.py
```

This command loads the definitions in `my_file.py` as a code location in the current Python environment.

You can also include multiple files at a time, where each file will be loaded as a code location:

```shell
dagster dev -f my_file.py -f my_second_file.py
```

Dagster can also load Python modules as [code locations](/concepts/code-locations). When this approach is used, Dagster loads the definitions defined at the top-level of the module, in a variable containing the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object of its root `__init__.py` file. As this style of development eliminates an entire class of Python import errors, we strongly recommend it for Dagster projects deployed to production.

In the following example, we used the `-m` argument to supply the name of the module:

```shell
dagster dev -m your_module_name
```

This command loads the definitions in the variable containing the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object in the named module - defined as the root `__init__.py` file - in the current Python environment.

You can also include multiple modules at a time, where each module will be loaded as a code location:

```shell
dagster dev -m your_module_name -m your_second_module
```

<TabItem name="Without command line arguments">

To load definitions without supplying command line arguments, you can use the `pyproject.toml` file. This file, included in all Dagster example projects, contains a `tool.dagster` section with a `module_name` variable:

```toml
[tool.dagster]
module_name = "your_module_name"  ## name of project's Python module
code_location_name = "your_code_location_name"  ## optional, name of code location to display in the Dagster UI
```

When defined, you can run this in the same directory as the `pyproject.toml` file:

```shell
dagster dev
```

Instead of this:

```shell
dagster dev -m your_module_name
```
