# Intro to ops and jobs, part one: Write a single-op job

<CodeReferenceLink filePath="examples/docs_snippets/docs_snippets/intro_tutorial/basics/single_op_job/" />

In this guide, we'll touch on Dagster [ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) and [jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs). [Ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops) are individual units of computation that we wire together to form [jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/op-jobs).

In this part, you'll:

- [Write your first op](#step-1-write-your-first-op)
- [Write your first job](#step-2-write-your-first-job)
- [Execute the job](#step-3-execute-your-first-job)

---

## Step 1: Write your first op

Let's write our first Dagster op and save it as `hello.py`.

Typically, you'll define ops by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject module="dagster" object="op" displayText="@op" /> decorator.

Our first op finds the sizes of all the files in our current directory and logs them.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_op_job/hello.py startafter=start_op_marker endbefore=end_op_marker
import os
from dagster import job, op, get_dagster_logger


@op
def get_file_sizes():
    files = [f for f in os.listdir(".") if os.path.isfile(f)]
    for f in files:
        get_dagster_logger().info(f"Size of {f} is {os.path.getsize(f)}")
```

In this simple case, our op takes no arguments, and also returns no outputs. Don't worry, we'll soon encounter ops that are more dynamic.

---

## Step 2: Write your first job

To execute our op, we'll embed it in an equally simple job. A job is a set of ops arranged into a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of computation. You'll typically define jobs by annotating ordinary Python functions with the <PyObject
module="dagster" object="job" displayText="@job" /> decorator.

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_op_job/hello.py startafter=start_job_marker endbefore=end_job_marker
@job
def file_sizes_job():
    get_file_sizes()
```

Here you'll see that we call `get_file_sizes()`. This call doesn't actually execute the op. Within the bodies of functions decorated with <PyObject module="dagster" object="job"
displayText="@job" />, we use function calls to indicate the dependency structure of the op making up the job. Here, we indicate that the execution of `get_file_sizes` doesn't depend on any other ops by calling it with no arguments.

## Step 3: Execute your first job

Assuming you’ve saved this job as `hello.py`, you can execute it via any of three different mechanisms:

<TabGroup>
    <TabItem name="Dagster UI">

### Dagster UI

To visualize your job (which only has one op) in the UI, just run the following. Make sure you're in the directory in which you've saved the job file:

```bash
dagster dev -f hello.py
```

You'll see output like:

```bash
Serving dagster-webserver on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
```

You should be able to navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000> in your web browser and view your job. It isn't very interesting yet, because it only has one op.

<!-- ![single-op job](/images/tutorial/single-op-job.png) -->

<Image
alt="single-op job"
src="/images/tutorial/single-op-job.png"
width={3574}
height={1962}
/>

Click on the **Launchpad** tab and you'll see the view below.

<!-- ![single-op launchpad](/images/tutorial/single-op-launchpad.png) -->

<Image
alt="single-op launchpad"
src="/images/tutorial/single-op-launchpad.png"
width={3574}
height={1962}
/>

The large upper left pane is empty here, but, in jobs with parameters, this is where you'll be able to edit job configuration on the fly.

Click the **Launch Run** button on the bottom right to execute this job directly from the UI. A new window should open, and you'll see a much more structured view of the stream of Dagster events start to appear in the left-hand pane.

If you have pop-up blocking enabled, you may need to tell your browser to allow pop-ups from 127.0.0.1—or, just navigate to the **Runs** tab to see this, and every run of your job.

<!-- ![single-op run](/images/tutorial/single-op-run.png) -->

<Image
alt="single-op run"
src="/images/tutorial/single-op-run.png"
width={3574}
height={1962}
/>

In this view, you can filter and search through the logs corresponding to your job run.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Dagster CLI">

### Dagster CLI

From the directory in which you've saved the job file, just run:

```bash
dagster job execute -f hello.py
```

You'll see the full stream of events emitted by Dagster appear in the console, including our call to the logging machinery, which will look like:

```bash
2021-02-05 08:50:25 - dagster - INFO - system - ce5d4576-2569-44ff-a14a-51010eea5329 - hello - ...
```

Success!

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Python API">

### Python API

If you'd rather execute your jobs as a script, you can do that without using the Dagster CLI at all. Just add a few lines to `hello.py`

```python file=/intro_tutorial/basics/single_op_job/hello.py startafter=start_execute_marker endbefore=end_execute_marker
if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = file_sizes_job.execute_in_process()
```

Now you can just run:

```bash
python hello.py
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

## What's next?

At this point, you should have an executed job that contains a single op. The next step is to [connect a series of ops in a job](/guides/dagster/intro-to-ops-jobs/connecting-ops).
