# Intro to ops and jobs

Dagster's asset functionality sits on top of a general orchestration engine that can be used for tasks other than creating and maintaining assets.

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- [Write and execute a job with a single op](/guides/dagster/intro-to-ops-jobs/single-op-job)
- [Connect multiple ops in a job](/guides/dagster/intro-to-ops-jobs/connecting-ops)
- [Learn to test ops and jobs](/guides/dagster/intro-to-ops-jobs/testable)

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need to install Dagster, the Dagster webserver/UI, and the `requests` library:

```shell
pip install dagster dagster-webserver
```

This installs a few packages:

- `dagster`. The core programming model and abstraction stack; stateless, single-node, single-process and multi-process execution engines; and a CLI tool for driving those engines. Refer to the [Dagster installation guide](/getting-started/install) for more info, including how to ensure your environment is set up correctly.
- `dagster-webserver`: The server for Dagster's browser UI for developing and operating Dagster jobs, including a DAG browser, a type-aware config editor, and a live execution interface.
