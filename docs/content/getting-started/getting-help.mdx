        about Dagster because its training data doesn’t include Dagster’s latest

## Tips

### Formatting code snippets

#### Creating code blocks with Markdown

When posting in GitHub or Slack, including a code snippet can help others understand your question. Using Markdown to format the content as code improves readability. For example:

      ```   # backticks create a code block
      from dagster import ...
      ...
      ```

#### Adding syntax highlighting

On GitHub - whether in issues or discussions - you can add syntax highlighting to code snippets to further improve readability. This is done by specifying the language at the top of the Markdown code block:

      ```python    ## specifies language
      from dagster import ...
      ...
      ```

### Reporting bugs

When filing a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/issues) for a bug:

- **DO** include the minimum-sized working code snippet that reproduces the issue
- **DO** include the steps you took to create the issue, if the issue occurred in the Dagster UI
- **DO** include the Dagster version being used, if applicable
- **DON'T** include any sensitive information

### Asking questions that get answers

When posting questions in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster/discussions) or [Slack](https://dagster.io/slack), we recommend:

- Being clear, specific, and as brief as possible
- Not including lots of irrelevant details

Generally, the less time and effort it takes for someone to digest your question, the more likely it will get answered. Check out the following sections for examples of well-phrased questions and those that could use some improvement.

**Question 1**

> **Is it possible to set up Dagster to automatically update an entire downstream table every time that a specific partition of an upstream table is updated?** We have a table that's partitioned by customer, and we have a specific analysis that we want to do on a specific customer.

✅ **Good question!**

This question is brief enough to be quickly digested, but specific enough to be complete.

**Question 2**

> **Is it possible to set up Dagster to automatically update an entire downstream table every time that a specific partition of an upstream table is updated?** We have a table that's partitioned by customer, and we have a specific analysis that we want to do on a specific customer.
>
> The background here is that that we've set up Fivetran to pulls in our per-customer Salesforce tables into one big Snowflake table. We have about 500 customers, and they get pulled in usually daily, but it depends on the customer. For about 20 of these customers, we have custom logic, implemented in SQL with dbt, that performs analyses that are specific to those customers. We want those analyses to run automatically when customer data is updated, so that our sales representatives can discover red flags when they check their Looker dashboards.

✅ **Good question!**

This version of the first question provides additional background information, but doesn't bury the core question. This can be helpful because it allows readers to more deeply understand the situation and provide broader suggestions.

---

**Question 3**

> **How do I use tables with specific upstream partitions?**

❌ **Needs improvement**

This question needs more detail to allow the reader to provide appropriate suggestions.

**Question 4**

> We've set up Fivetran to pulls in our per-customer Salesforce tables into one big Snowflake table. We have about 500 customers, and they get pulled in usually daily, but it depends on the customer. For about 20 of these customers, we have custom logic, implemented in SQL with dbt, that performs analyses that are specific to those customers. We want those analyses to run automatically when customer data is updated, so that our sales representatives can discover red flags when they check their Looker dashboards. **How can I get this working with Dagster?**

❌ **Needs improvement**

This question requires understanding an entire data pipeline to answer the core question.
