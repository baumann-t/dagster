# Open Source deployment architecture

<Note>
  This guide is applicable to Dagster Open Source (OSS) deployments. For
  Dagster+ deployments, refer to the{" "}
  <a href="/dagster-plus">Dagster+ documentation</a>.
</Note>

This page covers general information about deploying Dagster on your own infrastructure. For guides on specific platforms, refer to the [Deployment guides](/deployment/guides).

Let's take a look at a generic Dagster deployment, after which we'll walk through each of its components:

## Long-running services

Dagster requires three long-running services, which are outlined in the table below:

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "15%",
        }}
      >
        Service
      </th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "15%",
        }}
      >
        Replicas
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="/concepts/webserver/ui">Dagster webserver/UI</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        `dagster-webserver` serves the user interface and responds to GraphQL
        queries. It can have one or more replicas.
      </td>
      <td>Supported</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="/deployment/dagster-daemon">Dagster daemon</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        The Dagster daemon operates schedules, sensors, and run queuing.
        Currently, replicas are not supported.
      </td>
      <td>Not supported</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="/concepts/code-locations">Code location server</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        Code location servers serve metadata about the collection of its Dagster
        definitions. You can have many code location servers, but currently each
        code location can only have one replica for its server.
      </td>
      <td>Supported</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Deployment configuration

Dagster OSS deployments are composed of multiple components, such as storages, executors, and run launchers. One of the core features of Dagster is that each of these components is swappable and configurable. If custom configuration isn't provided, Dagster will automatically use a default implementation of each component. For example, by default Dagster uses <PyObject module="dagster._core.storage.runs" object="SqliteRunStorage" /> to store information about pipeline runs. This can be swapped with the Dagster-provided <PyObject module="dagster_postgres" object="PostgresRunStorage"/> instead or or a custom storage class.

Based on the component's scope, configuration occurs at either the **Dagster instance** or **Job run** level. Access to user code is configured at the **Workspace** level. Refer to the following table for info on how components are configured at each of these levels:

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "15%",
        }}
      >
        Level
      </th>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "15%",
        }}
      >
        Configuration
      </th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="/deployment/dagster-instance">Dagster instance</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>dagster.yaml</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        The Dagster instance is responsible for managing all deployment-wide
        components, such as the database. You can specify the configuration for
        instance-level components in <code>dagster.yaml</code>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <a href="/concepts/code-locations/workspace-files">Workspace</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        <code>workspace.yaml</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        Workspace files define how to access and load your code. You can define
        workspace configuration using <code>workspace.yaml</code>.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Job run</td>
      <td>Run config</td>
      <td>
        A job run is responsible for managing all job-scoped components, such as
        the executor, ops, and resources. These components dictate job behavior,
        such as how to execute ops or where to store outputs.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Configuration for run-level components is specified using the job run's run
        config, and defined in either Python code or in the <a href="/concepts/webserver/ui#launchpad">
          UI launchpad
        </a>.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Note>
  Dagster provides a few vertically-integrated deployment options that abstract
  away some of the configuration options described above. For example, with
  Dagster's provided{" "}
  <Link href="/deployment/guides/kubernetes/deploying-with-helm">
    Kubernetes Helm chart deployment
  </Link>
  , configuration is defined through Helm values, and the Kubernetes deployment automatically
  generates Dagster Instance and Workspace configuration.
</Note>

## Job execution flow

Job execution flows through several parts of the Dagster system. The following table describes runs launched by the UI, specifically the components that handle execution and the order in which they are executed.

<table
  className="table"
  style={{
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "5%",
        }}
      >
        Order
      </th>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "15%",
        }}
      >
        Component
      </th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th
        style={{
          width: "15%",
        }}
      >
        Configured by
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>
        <a href="/deployment/run-coordinator">Run coordinator</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        The run coordinator is a class invoked by the webserver process when
        runs are launched from the Dagster UI. This class can be configured to
        pass runs to the daemon via a queue.
      </td>
      <td>Instance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>
        <a href="/deployment/run-launcher">Run launcher</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        The run launcher is a class invoked by the daemon when it receives a run
        from the queue. This class initializes a new run worker to handle
        execution. Depending on the launcher, this could mean spinning up a new
        process, container, Kubernetes pod, etc.
      </td>
      <td>Instance</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Run worker</td>
      <td>
        The run worker is a process which traverses a graph and uses the
        executor to execute each op.
      </td>
      <td>n/a</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>
        <a href="/deployment/executors">Executor</a>
      </td>
      <td>
        The executor is a class invoked by the run worker for running user ops.
        Depending on the executor, ops run in local processes, new containers,
        Kubernetes pods, etc.
      </td>
      <td>Run config</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Additionally, note that runs launched by schedules and sensors go through the same flow, but the first step is called by the [Dagster daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon) instead of the webserver.

In a deployment without the [Dagster daemon](/deployment/dagster-daemon), the webserver directly calls the **run launcher** and skips the **run coordinator**.
