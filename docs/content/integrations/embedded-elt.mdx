# Dagster Embedded ELT

<ExperimentalCallout />

The `dagster-embedded-elt` package provides a framework for building ELT pipelines with Dagster through helpful asset decorators and resources.

This package includes two implementations:

1. [Sling](https://slingdata.io) to provide a simple way to sync data between databases and file systems
2. [data Load Tool (dlt)](https://dlthub.com) to easily load data from external systems and APIs

We plan to add additional embedded ELT tool integrations in the future.

## Sling

Sling provides an easy-to-use YAML configuration layer for loading data from files, replicating data between databases, exporting custom SQL queries to cloud storage, and much more. The Dagster integration allows you to derive Dagster assets from a replication configuration file.

## dlt

With the ability to leverage pre-made [verified sources](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/) like [Hubspot](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/hubspot) and [Notion](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/notion), and [destinations](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/) like [Databricks](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/databricks) and [Snowflake](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/destinations/snowflake), integrating dlt into your Dagster project enables you to load a data in an easy and structured way.
