# Tutorial: Using dbt with Dagster

<Note>
  Using dbt Cloud? Check out the{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt-cloud">dbt Cloud with Dagster guide</a>!
</Note>

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through integrating dbt with Dagster using a smaller version of dbt's example [jaffle shop project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop), the [dagster-dbt library](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt), and a data warehouse, such as [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have your dbt models represented in Dagster along with other [Dagster Software-defined Assets](/integrations/dbt/reference#dbt-models-and-dagster-software-defined-assets) upstream and downstream of them:

To get there, you will:

- [Set up a dbt project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/set-up-dbt-project)
- [Load the dbt models into Dagster as assets](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/load-dbt-models)
- [Create and materialize upstream Dagster assets](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/upstream-assets)
- [Create and materialize a downstream asset](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/downstream-assets) that outputs a plotly chart

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- **To have [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) installed**. If it's not installed already (find out by typing `git` in your terminal), you can install it using the [instructions on the git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

- **To install dbt, Dagster, and the Dagster webserver/UI**. Run the following to install everything using pip:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster-dbt dagster-webserver dbt-duckdb
  ```

  The `dagster-dbt` library installs both `dbt-core` and `dagster` as dependencies. `dbt-duckdb` is installed as you'll be using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) as a database during this tutorial. Refer to the [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/install/overview) and [Dagster](/getting-started/install) installation docs for more info.
