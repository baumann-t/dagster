# Managing teams in Dagster+

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster+ Pro.</Note>

As part of our [role-based access control (RBAC) feature](/dagster-plus/account/managing-users/managing-user-roles-permissions), Dagster+ supports the ability to assign users to teams. A team is a group of users with a set of default deployment, code location, and Branch Deployment user roles.

In this guide, we'll cover how to add, manage, and remove teams in Dagster+.

---

## Prerequisites

To use this feature, you'll need a **Dagster+ Pro plan.**

## Adding teams

<Note>

  are required to add teams.

2. Click the **Teams** tab.
