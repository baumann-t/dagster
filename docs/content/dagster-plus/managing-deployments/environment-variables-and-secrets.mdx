### Storage and encryption

<Note>
  This section is applicable only if using the Dagster+ UI to manage environment
  variables.
</Note>

To securely store environment variables defined using the Dagster+ UI, Dagster+ uses [Amazon Key Management Services (KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/index.html) and [envelope encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/concepts.html#enveloping). Envelope encryption is a multi-layered approach to key encryption. Plaintext data is encrypted using a data key, and then the data under the data key is encrypted under another key.

Here's a look at how it works in Dagster+:

<center>
  <Image
    alt="Dagster+ encryption key hierarchy diagram"
    src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/environment-variables/encryption-key-hierarchy.png"
    width={836}
    height={561}
  />
</center>

In Dagster+, each customer account is assigned a unique key, which then encrypts the data associated with that account. All customer keys are encrypted using a non-exportable AWS KMS master key.

This approach isolates each account's data and reduces the risk of exposure by limiting the amount of data a single key can access.

### Scope

<Note>
  This section is applicable only if using the Dagster+ UI to manage environment
  variables.
</Note>

Environment variables can be scoped to specific deployments and/or code locations. When creating or modifying an environment variable, you'll be prompted to select the deployment(s) to scope the variable to:

- **Full deployment** - Variables with this scope will be available to selected code locations in the full deployment

- **Branch deployments** - Variables with this scope will be available to selected code locations in Branch Deployments.

  **Note**: While viewing a Branch Deployment in Dagster+, variables will be read-only. Environment variables must be managed in the Branch Deployment's parent full deployment, which will usually be `prod`.

- **Local** - Variables with this scope will be included when [downloading variables to a local `.env` file](#exporting-variables-to-a-env-file)

By default, new environment variables default to all deployments and all code locations.

#### Same variable, different scopes and values

You can create multiple instances of the same environment variable with different values for different scopes. Each instance of the variable can then be scoped to a deployment and code location (or locations). This approach can be useful for parameterizing behavior by environment without needing to modify your application code.

For example, let's say we want to use different database passwords in production and testing (Branch Deployments). In our code, we use the `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` environment variable to pass in the database password. To use different passwords between production and Branch Deployments, we can create two instances of `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`. One instance is scoped to the `prod` deployment and the other only to Branch Deployments:

<Image
alt="Example SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD variables configured with different values based on deployment"
src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/environment-variables/same-variable-diff-scope.png"
width={1037}
height={188}
/>

In this example, the value of `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` would be `production_password` in the `prod` deployment and `testing_password` in a Branch Deployment.

### Reserved variables

<Note>
  This section is applicable only if using the Dagster+ UI to manage environment
  variables.
</Note>

[Built-in (system) Dagster+ environment variables](#built-in-environment-variables) are reserved and therefore unavailable for use. [An error will surface in Dagster+](#troubleshooting) if a built-in variable name is used.

---

## Managing environment variables

The simplest way to manage environment variables is to use Dagster+'s built-in manager which allows you to create and manage environment variables right in the UI.

### Using the Dagster+ UI

<Note>
  To manage environment variables using the Dagster+ UI, you need:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Organization</strong>, <strong>Admin</strong>, or{" "}
      <strong>Editor</strong> permissions. If you're a Dagster+{" "}
      <a href="/dagster-plus/account/managing-users">
        <strong>Editor</strong> or <strong>Admin</strong>
      </a>
      , you can only set environment variables for full deployments where you're
      an <strong>Editor</strong> or <strong>Admin</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Dagster code on version 1.0.17 or later. If using Hybrid, your agent must
      also use 1.0.17 or later.
    </li>
  </ul>
</Note>

- [Editing, viewing, and deleting variables](#editing-viewing-and-deleting-variables)
- [Exporting variables to a `.env` file](#exporting-variables-to-a-env-file)

#### Creating new variables

1. Sign in to your Dagster+ account.

2. Click **Deployment > Environment variables**.

3. Click **+ Add Environment Variable** to add a new environment variable.

4. In the window that displays, fill in the following:

   - **Name** - Enter a name for the environment variable. This is how the variable will be referenced in your code.
   - **Value** - Enter a value for the environment variable.
   - In **Deployment Scope**, select the deployment(s) where the variable should be accessible:
     - **Full deployment** - The variable will be available to selected code locations in the full deployment
     - **Branch deployments** - The variable will be available to selected code locations in Branch Deployments
     - **Local** - If selected, the variable will be included when [exporting environment variables to a local `.env` file](#exporting-variables-to-a-env-file)
   - In **Code Location Scope**, select the code location(s) where the variable should be accessible. At least one code location is required. Refer to the [Scope](#scope) section for more info.

   For example:

   <Image
   alt="Create new environment variable dialog window in Dagster+"
   src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/environment-variables/create-new-variable-in-ui.png"
   width={636}
   height={370}
   />

5. When finished, click **Save**. Dagster+ will automatically re-deploy the workspace to apply the changes.

#### Editing, viewing, and deleting variables

After the environment variable is created:

- **To edit an environment variable**, click the **Edit** button.
- **To view an environment variable's value**, click the **eye icon** in the variable's **Value** column. Click the icon again to conceal the value.
- **To delete an environment variable**, click the **Trash icon** and confirm the deletion when prompted.

#### Exporting variables to a .env file

All variables with the `local` deployment scope can be exported to an `.env` file and used locally. To create the file:

1. In the **Environment variables** tab, click the menu next to **+ Add environment variable**:

   <Image
   alt="Highlighted Download local variables file in Environment Variables tab of Dagster+"
   src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/environment-variables/dagster-cloud-download-local.png"
   width={1174}
   height={266}
   />

2. Click **Download local environment variables**

3. Save the file. **Note**: If saved to the same folder where you run `dagster-webserver`, Dagster will [automatically load the variables in the `.env` file](/guides/dagster/using-environment-variables-and-secrets#declaring-environment-variables) when the webserver is started.

### Using agent configuration (Hybrid)

<Note>Only supported for Hybrid deployments.</Note>

For Dagster+ Hybrid deployments, making environment variables accessible is accomplished by adding them to your agent's configuration. How this is accomplished depends on the agent type.

Refer to the [Setting environment variables for Dagster+ agents guide](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/setting-environment-variables-agents) for more info.

## Built-in environment variables

[Dagster+](/dagster-plus) provides a set of built-in, automatically populated environment variables, such as the name of a deployment or details about a branch deployment commit, that can be used to modify behavior based on environment.

### All deployment variables

The following variables are available in every deployment of your Dagster+ instance, including full (e.g., `prod`) and branch deployments.

<ReferenceTable>
  <ReferenceTableItem propertyName="DAGSTER_CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT_NAME">
    The name of the Dagster+ deployment. For example, <code>prod</code>.
  </ReferenceTableItem>
  <ReferenceTableItem propertyName="DAGSTER_CLOUD_IS_BRANCH_DEPLOYMENT">
    If <code>1</code>, the deployment is a{" "}
    <a href="/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/branch-deployments">

    . Refer to the <a href="#branch-deployment-variables">
      Branch Deployment variables section
    </a> for a list of variables available in branch deployments.
  </ReferenceTableItem>
</ReferenceTable>

### Branch Deployment variables

The following environment variables are currently available only in a [branch deployment](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/branch-deployments).

For every commit made to a branch, the following metadata is available:
