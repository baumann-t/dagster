# Managing alert policies in Dagster+

<ApplicableDagsterProduct />

In this guide, we'll walk you through managing alert policies in Dagster+.

**Prefer to work in code?** You can also define and set alert policies using the [`dagster-cloud` CLI](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts/managing-alerts-cli).

---

## Prerequisites

To follow the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **Organization, Admin, or Editor permissions in Dagster+**, which are required to create and manage alerts
- **Optional**: If using an integration like [Microsoft Teams](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts/microsoft-teams) or [Slack](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts/slack) as a notification service, complete the integration setup before proceeding. Refer to the [Supported notification services](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts#supported-notification-services) for a complete list of integrations.

## Creating alert policies

1. Sign in to your Dagster+ account.

2. In the top navigation, click **Deployment**.

3. Click the **Alerts** tab.

4. Click **+ Create alert policy**.

5. In the **Create alert policy** window, select an [alert type](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts#alert-policy-types) and enter a name and description for the alert.

6. **If creating an asset or run alert policy**, you'll be prompted to fill in the following:

   <details>
     <summary>
       <strong>Asset alert policies</strong>
     </summary>
     <ul>
       <li>
         <strong>Target</strong> - Select the assets that the alert targets:
         <ul>
           <li>
             <strong>All assets</strong> - All assets in the deployment
           </li>
           <li>
             <strong>Group</strong> - All assets in a specific asset group in
             the deployment
           </li>
           <li>
             <strong>Asset key</strong> - A specific asset key in the deployment
           </li>
         </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>Events</strong> - Select the event(s) that should trigger the
         alert. For example: asset materialization failure, asset check passed.
       </li>
     </ul>
   </details>

   <details>
     <summary>
       <strong>Run alert policies</strong>
     </summary>
     <ul>
       <li>
         <strong>Tags</strong> - Add tag(s) for the alert policy. Jobs with
         these tags will trigger the alert. For example:{" "}
         <code>level:critical</code> or <code>team:sales</code>
       </li>
       <li>
         <strong>Events</strong> - Select whether the alert should trigger on
         job success, failure, or both
       </li>
     </ul>
   </details>

7. In the **Notification service** section, select how the alert will be delivered. Refer to the [Supported notification services](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts#supported-notification-services) section for information about setting up these services.

   **Note**: If creating an asset alert, an additional **Email asset owners (experimental)** option will be available.

8. When finished, click **Save policy**.

   />

   This will open a window displaying all alert policies in YAML format:

   <Image
   alt="Editing YAML for multiple alert policies"
