# Using Branch Deployments (CI) with GitHub Actions

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster+.</Note>

In this guide, we'll walk you through setting up Continuous Integration (CI) using [Branch Deployments](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/branch-deployments) with GitHub Actions.

Using this approach to branch deployments may be a good fit if:

- You use GitHub for version control
- You want Dagster to fully automate Branch Deployments

**If you don't use GitHub for version control or want full control over your setup**, check out the [Branch deployments with the `dagster-cloud CLI` guide](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/branch-deployments/using-branch-deployments).

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **Organization Admin** permissions in Dagster+
- **The ability to run a new agent in your infrastructure**. This isn't required if you're using [Serverless deployment](/dagster-plus/deployment/serverless).
- **The ability to configure GitHub Actions for your repository**. This isn't required if you used the Dagster+ GitHub app to connect your repository as a [code location](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/code-locations).

---

## Step 1: Generate a Dagster+ agent token

<GenerateAgentToken />

---

## Step 2: Create and configure an agent

<Note>
  <strong>
    If using{" "}
    <a href="/dagster-plus/deployment/serverless">Serverless deployment</a>
  </strong>
  , this step isn't required.
</Note>

<BDCreateConfigureAgent />

---

## Step 3: Add GitHub workflow files to your repository

<Note>
  If you used the GitHub app to add the repository as a code location, this step
  isn't required.{" "}
  <a href="#step-4-configure-the-github-repository">Skip to the next step</a>.
</Note>

In this step, you'll add the required GitHub workflow files to your GitHub repository. The files can be found in our [Hybrid quickstart repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart) or [Serverless quickstart repository](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-serverless-quickstart), depending on the agent you are using.

Copy the following files to your repository (the linked files are shown in the Hybrid repo, there are equivalents in the Serverless repo).

- [`dagster_cloud.yaml`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart/blob/main/dagster_cloud.yaml)
- [`.github/workflows/dagster-cloud-deploy.yml`](https://github.com/dagster-io/dagster-cloud-hybrid-quickstart/blob/main/.github/workflows/dagster-cloud-deploy.yml)

In the next step, you'll modify these files to work with your Dagster+ setup.

---

## Step 4: Configure the GitHub repository

In this section, you'll:

1. [Add the agent registry to `dagster_cloud.yaml`](#step-41-add-the-agent-registry-to-dagster_cloudyaml)
2. [Configure GitHub Action secrets](#step-42-configure-github-action-secrets)
3. [Update GitHub Workflow files](#step-43-update-github-workflow-files)
4. [Verify Action runs](#step-44-verify-action-runs)

### Step 4.1: Add the agent registry to dagster_cloud.yaml

<Note>
  If you're using Serverless deployment, this step isn't required.{" "}
  <a href="#step-42-configure-github-action-secrets">Skip to the next step</a>.
</Note>

In the [`dagster_cloud.yaml` file](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-cloud-yaml), replace `build.registry` with the registry used by the [agent you created in Step 2](#step-2-create-and-configure-an-agent).

For example:

```yaml
# dagster_cloud.yaml

locations:
  - location_name: example_location
    code_source:
      python_file: repo.py
    build:
      directory: ./example_location
      registry: 764506304434.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/branch-deployment-agent
```

### Step 4.2: Configure GitHub Action secrets

<Note>
  If you used the GitHub app to add the repository as a code location, this step{" "}
  isn't required.
  <br></br>
  <br></br>
  <strong>Want to use secrets in your Dagster code?</strong> Check out the <a href="/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets">
    Dagster+ environment variables and secrets guide
  </a> for more info.
</Note>

<AddGitubRepositorySecret />

**For Hybrid deployments,** repeat steps 3-6 for each of the secrets required for your registry type:

<TabGroup>
  <TabItem name="Select registry type">
Select the tab for your registry type to view instructions.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem name="Amazon ECR">

- `DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN` - The Dagster+ agent token you created in [Step 1](#step-1-generate-a-dagster-agent-token)
- `ORGANIZATION_ID` - Your Dagster+ organization ID
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` - The **Access key ID** of the AWS IAM user you created in [Step 2](#step-2-create-and-configure-an-agent)
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - The **Secret access key** of the AWS IAM user you created in [Step 2](#step-2-create-and-configure-an-agent)
- `AWS_REGION` - The AWS region where your ECR registry is located

The **Actions secrets** page should look like the following:

<Image
alt="Configured GitHub Actions secrets for an AWS ECR registry"
src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments/github-aws-ecr.png"
width={1091}
height={623}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Docker">

- `DAGSTER_CLOUD_API_TOKEN` - The Dagster+ agent token you created in [Step 1](#step-1-generate-a-dagster-agent-token)
- `ORGANIZATION_ID` - Your Dagster+ organization ID
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - Your DockerHub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` - A DockerHub [access token](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/#create-an-access-token)

The **Actions secrets** page should look like the following:

<Image
alt="Required GitHub Actions secrets for a DockerHub registry"
src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments/github-dockerhub.png"
width={790}
height={318}
/>

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

### Step 4.3: Update GitHub Workflow files

<Note>
  If you're using Serverless deployment, this step isn't required.{" "}
  <a href="#step-42-configure-github-action-secrets">Skip to the next step</a>.
</Note>

In this step, you'll update the GitHub Workflow files in the repository to set up Docker registry access.

In the `.github/workflows/dagster-cloud-deploy.yml` file, uncomment the `step` associated with your registry. For example, for an Amazon ECR registry, you'd uncomment the following portion of the workflow file:

```yaml
jobs:
  dagster-cloud-deploy:
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
```

Save and commit the file to the repository.

### Step 4.4: Verify Action runs

The last step is to verify that the Action runs successfully.

1. In the repository, click the **Actions** tab.
2. In the list of workflows, locate the latest branch deployment run. For example:

   <Image
   alt="A successful run for a Branch Deployment Action"
   src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments/github-verify-run.png"
   width={1263}
   height={651}
   />

If the run finished successfully, that's it!

## Step 5: Access the branch deployment

Now that Branch Deployments are configured, you can check out the preview in Dagster+. There are two ways to do this:

- [From a pull request](#from-a-pull-request)
- [Directly in Dagster+](#directly-in-dagster)

### From a pull request

Every pull request in the repository contains a **View in Cloud** link:

<Image
alt="View in Cloud preview link highlighted in a GitHub pull request"
src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments/github-cloud-preview-link.png"
width={922}
height={521}
/>

Clicking the link will open a branch deployment - or a preview of the changes - in Dagster+.

### Directly in Dagster+

You can also access branch deployments directly in Dagster+ from the **deployment switcher**:

<Image
alt="Highlighted branch deployment in the Dagster+ deployment switcher"
src="/images/dagster-cloud/developing-testing/branch-deployments/dagster-ui-deployment-switcher.png"
width={563}
height={311}
/>
