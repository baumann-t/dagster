# Integrating BigQuery & dbt with Dagster+ Insights

BigQuery costs can be integrated into the Dagster Insights UI. The [`dagster-cloud`](https://pypi.org/project/dagster-cloud/) package contains utilities for capturing and submitting BigQuery cost metrics about data operations to Dagster+.

If you use dbt to materialize tables in BigQuery, use this guide to integrate BigQuery cost metrics into the Insights UI. For instructions on integrating direct BigQuery queries, see [Integrating Direct BigQuery Usage with Dagster+ Insights](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-bigquery).

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- A Dagster+ account on the Pro plan
- Access to the [Dagster+ Insights feature](/dagster-plus/insights)
- BigQuery credentials which have access to the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` table (e.g. BigQuery Resource viewer role). These credentials should be provided used by your dbt profile. For more information on granting access to this table, see the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs).
- To install the following libraries:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster dagster-cloud dagster-dbt dagster-gcp
  ```

  **Note**: If you already have `dagster-cloud` installed, **make sure you're using version 1.7.0 or newer**.

## Step 1: Instrument your Dagster code

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Using assets">

First, instrument the Dagster <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="dbt_assets" decorator /> function with `dbt_with_bigquery_insights`:

```python
from dagster_cloud.dagster_insights import dbt_with_bigquery_insights


@dbt_assets(...)
def my_asset(context: AssetExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    # Typically you have a `yield from dbt_resource.cli(...)`.
    # Wrap the original call with `dbt_with_bigquery_insights` as below.
    dbt_cli_invocation = dbt_resource.cli(["build"], context=context)
    yield from dbt_with_bigquery_insights(context, dbt_cli_invocation)
```

This passes through all underlying events and emits additional <PyObject object="AssetObservation" pluralize /> with BigQuery cost metrics. These metrics are obtained by querying the underlying `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` table, using the BigQuery client from the dbt adapter.

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Using ops and jobs">

First, instrument the op function with `dbt_with_bigquery_insights`:

```python
from dagster_cloud.dagster_insights import dbt_with_bigquery_insights


@op(out={})
def my_dbt_op(context: OpExecutionContext, dbt: DbtCliResource):
    # Typically you have a `yield from dbt_resource.cli(...)`.
    # Wrap the original call with `dbt_with_bigquery_insights` as below.
    dbt_cli_invocation = dbt.cli(
        ["build"], context=context, manifest=dbt_manifest_path
    )
    yield from dbt_with_bigquery_insights(context, dbt_cli_invocation)

@job
def my_dbt_job():
  ...
  my_dbt_op()
  ...
```

This passes through all underlying events and emits additional `AssetObservation`s with BigQuery cost metrics. These metrics are obtained by querying the underlying `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` table, using the BigQuery client from the dbt adapter.

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

---

## Step 2: Update dbt_project.yml

Next, add the following to your dbt project's `dbt_project.yml`:

```yaml
query-comment:
  comment: "bigquery_dagster_dbt_v1_opaque_id[[[{{ node.unique_id }}:{{ invocation_id }}]]]"
  append: true
```

This allows you to add a comment, containing the dbt invocation ID and unique ID, to every query recorded in BigQuery's `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` table. Using this data, Insights will attribute cost metrics in BigQuery to the corresponding Dagster jobs and assets.

---

## Step 3: View BigQuery usage in the Dagster UI

Typically within 24 hours, the BigQuery metrics should be available in the **Insights** tab in the Dagster UI:

<!-- ![BigQuery credits in the Insights tab of the Dagster UI](/images/dagster-cloud/insights/insights-bigquery.png) -->

<Image
alt="BigQuery metrics in the Insights tab of the Dagster UI"
src="/images/dagster-cloud/insights/insights-bigquery.png"
width={3454}
height={1338}
/>

The BigQuery cost metric is based off of the bytes billed for queries wrapped with `dbt_with_bigquery_insights`, based on a unit price of $6.25 USD per TiB.
