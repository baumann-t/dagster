# Integrating Google BigQuery usage with Dagster+ Insights

External metrics, such as Google BigQuery usage, can be integrated into the Dagster Insights UI. The [`dagster-cloud`](https://pypi.org/project/dagster-cloud/) package contains utilities for capturing and submitting external metrics about data operations to Dagster+ via an API.

If you use the [BigQuery resource](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-snowflake), use this guide to integrate BigQuery metrics into the Insights UI. For instructions on integrating usage of dbt models that run in BigQuery, see [Integrating BigQuery & dbt with Dagster+ Insights](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-bigquery-and-dbt).

---

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- A Dagster+ account on the Pro plan
- Access to the [Dagster+ Insights feature](/dagster-plus/insights)
- BigQuery credentials that have access to the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS` table. For more information on granting access to this table, see the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-jobs).
- To install the following libraries:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster dagster-cloud dagster-gcp
  ```

  **Note**: If you already have `dagster-cloud` installed, **make sure you're using version 1.7.0 or newer**.

## Step 1: Replace your BigQuery resources

The first step is to replace any existing BigQuery resources with <PyObject module="dagster_cloud" object="InsightsBigQueryResource" />. This resource is a drop-in replacement for the <PyObject module="dagster_bigquery" object="BigQueryResource" /> resource, but it also emits BigQuery usage metrics to the Dagster+ Insights API.

```python
from dagster_cloud.dagster_insights import InsightsBigQueryResource

defs = Definitions(
  resources={
    "bigquery": InsightsBigQueryResource(project="my-project")
  }
)
```

---

## Step 2: View BigQuery usage in the Dagster UI

Once the pipeline runs, BigQuery usage will be visible in the **Insights** tab in the Dagster UI:

<!-- ![BigQuery credits in the Insights tab of the Dagster UI](/images/dagster-cloud/insights/insights-bigquery.png) -->

<Image
alt="BigQuery metrics in the Insights tab of the Dagster UI"
src="/images/dagster-cloud/insights/insights-bigquery.png"
width={3454}
height={1338}
/>

The BigQuery cost metric is based off of the bytes billed for queries performed using the <PyObject module="dagster_cloud" object="InsightsBigQueryResource" />, based on a unit price of $6.25 USD per TiB.
