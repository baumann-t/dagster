# Integrating external metrics into Dagster+ Insights

External metrics, such as Snowflake credits, can be integrated into the Dagster Insights UI. The [`dagster-cloud`](https://pypi.org/project/dagster-cloud/) package contains utilities for capturing and submitting external metrics about data operations to Dagster+ via an API.

---

## Limitations

Before you start, note that:

- This is a Dagster+ Pro feature
- Up to two million individual data points may be added to Insights, per month
- External metrics data will only be retained for 120 days

---

## Supported integrations

Currently, Insights supports integrating metrics for:

- **Usage generated by queries made to Google BigQuery and Snowflake resources.** Refer to the [BigQuery](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-bigquery) and [Snowflake](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-snowflake) integration guides for more information.

- **Google BigQuery and Snowflake usage generated by dbt.** Refer to the [BigQuery](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-bigquery-and-dbt) and [Snowflake](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-snowflake-and-dbt) dbt integration guides for more information.
