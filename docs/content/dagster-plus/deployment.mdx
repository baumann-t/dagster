# Dagster+ deployment types

Dagster+ currently offers two deployment options to meet your needs: Serverless and Hybrid.

---

## Serverless deployments

A Serverless deployment allows you to run Dagster jobs without spinning up any infrastructure. This fully-managed version of Dagster+ is the easiest way to get started with Dagster.

## Hybrid deployments

A Hybrid deployment utilizes a combination of your infrastructure and Dagster-hosted backend services.

The Dagster backend services - including the web frontend, GraphQL API, metadata database, and daemons (responsible for executing schedules and sensors) - are hosted in Dagster+.

An [agent](/dagster-plus/deployment/agents) you run in your infrastructure is responsible for executing your Dagster code.
