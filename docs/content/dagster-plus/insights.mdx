- [Export metrics from Dagster+](#exporting-metrics)
- [Create alerts for different metrics](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/alerts)

## How it works

Insights makes it easier to capture operational data not only from Dagster pipelines, but also downstream systems. Visualizations are built right into the Dagster UI, allowing you to explore Dagster usage alongside metrics from other platforms, like Google BigQuery.

To access Insights, click **Insights** in the top navigation bar in the UI:

<!-- ![Viewing the Insights tab in the Dagster UI](/images/dagster-cloud/insights/insights-tab.png) -->

/>

The left navigation panel on this page contains a list of [available metrics](#available-metrics). For each metric, the daily, weekly, or monthly aggregated values are displayed in the graph.

Use the tabs above the charts to view metrics for **Assets**, **Asset groups**, **Jobs**, and **Deployments**.

These metrics are updated on a daily basis. Refer to the [Available metrics](#available-metrics) section for more information about these metrics.

### Data retention

How long historical Insights data is retained depends on your Dagster+ plan:

- **Dagster+ Pro** - 120 days
- **All other plans** - 30 days

## Working with metrics

### Integrating other metrics

Other metrics, such as asset materialization metadata or Snowflake credits, can be integrated into Dagster Insights. Insights currently supports the following external metrics:

- **Asset materialization metadata.** Refer to the [Using asset metadata with Dagster+ Insights guide](/dagster-plus/insights/asset-metadata) for more info.
- **Google BigQuery usage** generated by either [queries made to BigQuery resources](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-bigquery) or [using dbt to materialize tables](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-bigquery-and-dbt)
- **Snowflake usage** generated by either [queries made to Snowflake resources](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-snowflake) or [using dbt to materialize tables](/dagster-plus/insights/integrating-snowflake-and-dbt)

### Exporting metrics

Metrics in Dagster+ Insights can be exported using a GraphQL API endpoint. Refer to the [Exporting Insights metrics from Dagster+ guide](/dagster-plus/insights/exporting-insights-metrics) for details.
