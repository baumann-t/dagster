# Configuring and running a local agent

<Note>This guide is applicable to Dagster+.</Note>

In this guide, you'll configure and run a local agent. Local agents are used to launch user code in operating system subprocesses.

**Considering running the agent in production?** Running the local agent in production can be a good choice if:

- Load is relatively light (guaranteed to fit on a single node)
- Jobs aren’t computationally intensive and don’t use much memory
- A Kubernetes cluster is prohibitively difficult to set up
- You can restart the agent when you update your code

Keep in mind that the local agent’s ability to run jobs is limited by the capacity of the single node on which it’s running.

If you’re running the local agent in production, make sure you’ve set up a supervisor to automatically restart the agent process if it crashes. You’ll also want a system in place to alert you if the VM or container dies, or to automatically restart it.

## Prerequisites

To complete the steps in this guide, you'll need:

- **Permissions in Dagster+ that allow you to manage agent tokens**. Refer to the [User permissions documentation](/dagster-plus/account/managing-users) for more info.
- **To install the [`dagster-cloud` CLI](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/dagster-plus-cli)**. This should be in the same environment where the agent will run.

  **Note**: Your Dagster application code and its Python and system requirements must also be installed in this environment. We recommend using Python [virtual environments](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) to accomplish this.

## Step 1: Generate a Dagster+ agent token

<GenerateAgentToken />

---

## Step 2: Configure the agent

1. Create a directory on disk to act as your Dagster home. We'll use `~/dagster_home` in our examples, but this directory can be located wherever you want.

2. In the directory you created, create a `dagster.yaml` file like the following:

   ```yaml
   # ~/dagster_home/dagster.yaml

   instance_class:
     module: dagster_cloud.instance
     class: DagsterCloudAgentInstance

   dagster_cloud_api:
     agent_token: <YOUR_AGENT_TOKEN>
     deployment: prod

   user_code_launcher:
     module: dagster_cloud.workspace.user_code_launcher
     class: ProcessUserCodeLauncher
   ```

3. In the file, fill in the following:

   - `agent_token` - Add the agent token you created in [Step 1](#step-1-generate-a-dagster-agent-token). This specifies that the agent will launch work in local processes, reading the API URL and authentication token from environment variables.

   - `deployment` - Enter the deployment associated with this instance of the agent.

     In the above example, we specified `prod` as the deployment. This is present when Dagster+ organizations are first created.

4. Save the file.

## Step 3: Run the agent

Next, run the process agent by pointing at the home directory you created:

```shell
dagster-cloud agent run ~/dagster_home/
```

To view the agent in Dagster+, click the Dagster icon in the top left to navigate to the **Status** page and click the **Agents** tab. You should see the agent running in the **Agent statuses** section:

<Image
alt="Instance Status"

## Next steps

Now that you've got your agent running, what's next?

- **If you're getting Dagster+ set up**, the next step is to [add a code location](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/code-locations) using the agent.

- **If you're ready to load your Dagster code**, refer to the [Adding Code to Dagster+](/dagster-plus/managing-deployments/code-locations) guide for more info.
